# Real_time_currency_vegitable_recognition
The system is able to detect grocery product and indian currency.
Abstractâ€”we all come across instances in our existence lives where visually impaired people take time to locate expected things and await the cashier at a retail store. Fake currency is the other part of concern in the world of visually impaired people. Increased technical improvements have created the likelihood of more fake currency being disseminated in the market, lowering the country's total economy. Because automatic product recognition and currency detection are more dependable and time-saving than human operation, it will be hassle-free for them. The suggested system employs image processing to determine whether the currency is accurate or not. More precisely, this study examines the major hurdle of deep learning for retail product detection, the other part is detecting currency value. In this paper, we introduce a new classification approach for a difficult problem in this project: the categorization of fruit and vegetables, veggies, and frozen items in super markets, such as milk packages and juice cartons. The entire system is self-contained and operates in real-time. The suggested teachable, neural model, according to the test results, the model-based method has detection and recognition algorithms exceeding 99 percent and 99 percent, respectively.
